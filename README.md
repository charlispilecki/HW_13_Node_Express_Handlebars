# HW_13_Node_Express_Handlebars

## About

For this assignment, I used Javascript, Node, MySQL, Express, Heroku, Bulma, JawsDB, etc. to create a site that allows the user to add and delete books on an "Unread Books" list. Once that book has been read by the user, they can move the book over to the "Read Books" list. 
Although the directive was to use burgers as the list items in question, I did not find that to be relevant and so I changed the burgers to books. I have never encountered someone who wanted to make a list of burgers they have and have not eaten; I do, however, know many people with books on a "Want To Read" list.
